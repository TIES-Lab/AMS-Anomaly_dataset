This documentation describes the tests run on each amplifer. See the
accompanying screenshots showing settings. They show the ADE L settings
as well as the parametric tool settings and an example of the test outcome.
Screenshots of all tests were taken and are in the Data Screen Captures Folder.

ADE L was used to simulate these circuits.
Circuit schematics were rearranged by hand for each test. DC tests are run
with a DC configuration of the circuit.(A VDC source from analog library) AC 
tests are run with an AC circuit config.(A VSIN source from analog library)
The tests are set up as follows all with linear 150 points:

DCTempGain: 
To be plotted out0, out1, out2
Design variable Vin selected and varied from 0 - 1.6V with 150 linear points
Parametric test selected to vary temp from -60-150 degrees Celcuis

DCParamTransient:
To be plotted out0, out1, out2, Vin
Transient analysis for 3mS
Options start at 0. Step and max step set to .02mS providing 150 points
Parametric test selected to vary Vin from 0-1.6V at 150 linear points

ACParamTransient:
To be plotted out0, out1, out2, Vin
Transient selected with same options
Parametric test used to vary offset single stage 250m - 750m
				    dual stage   150m - 575m


The following values are used to set up the amplifiers:
