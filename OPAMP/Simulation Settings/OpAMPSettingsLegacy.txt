 
This documentation describes the tests run on each amplifer
and the naming convention used to identify each configuration and test.

ADE L was used to simulate these circuits.
The current process is: A circuit schematic is drawn by hand. An ADE L session
is started. Three Tests are added along with gloabal variables. DC tests are run
with a DC configuration of the circuit.(A VDC source from analog library) AC 
tests are run with an AC circuit config.(A VSIN source from analog library)
The tests are set up as follows all with linear 150 points:

DCGain: 
To be plotted out0, out1, out2
Design variable Vin selected and varied from 0 - 1.6V with 150 linear points
Parametric test selected to vary temp from -60-150 degrees Celcuis

DCTransient:
To be plotted out0, out1, out2, Vin
Transient analysis for 3mS
Options start at 0. Step and max step set to .02mS providing 150 points
Parametric test selected to vary Vin from 0-1.6V at 150 linear points

ACTransient:
To be plotted out0, out1, out2, Vin
Transient selected with same options
Parametric test used to vary amplitude ....


The following global variables are used:
Single		Dual		Tripple

Vin 750m	Vin 500m	Vin 450m
R0 17.5k	R0 17.5k	R0 18.75k

Rf1 na		Rf1 35k		Rf1 35k
R2 na		R2 na		R2 10k
Rf2 na		Rf2 na		Rf2 20k

DATA Folder has all complete tests of interest with folders for single, dual, and tristage.
The folder also contains extracted data folders containing mean variance and slope for each 
trace in the tests. The nameing convention described below is used. Files that have been
extracted are prepended with 'Features'.

Each data folder is seperated into single, Dual and Tripple stage folders. The naming
convention is based on a 3 letter acynynm system that explains the number of stages
as well as which amplifiers were used. N - stands for non-Anomalous amplifier.
P - stands for anomalous PFET amplifier. A - stands for anomalous NFET amplifier.
The configuration of the tests is appended to the name for easy searching. Examples
follow for each of the 5 Tests:

TransientACN - Transisent anlaysis with AC source on NonAnomalous single stage Amp
FreqAnalysisNAA - Frequency analysis on tripple stage amp NonAnomalous-AnomPFET-AnomPFET
GainNP - DC Gain sweep on dual stage amp NonAnomalous-AnomalousPFET
Temp_N60_150_NN - DC temperature Sweep on Nonanomalous dual stage amp
TransientDCp - Transient DC analysis on single stage AnomalousPFET
