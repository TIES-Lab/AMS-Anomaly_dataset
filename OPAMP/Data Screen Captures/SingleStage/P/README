This folder contains simulation data for the single stage anomalous pfet amplifier.
The same tests will be run as on the non-anomalous amplifier. Operating point data
is gathered through the ade assembler which is labeled as Maestro in the library
manager. Differences include sub unity amplification and lower offset voltage compared
to the non-anomalous amplifier. The amplifier has also been assigned a label to dis-
-tinquish it in a multi stage configuration.

1-4 Notes:

It may be possible to automate testing through the use of a SKILL script. OCEAN
Functions can make the process easier. OCEAN scripts can be downloaded directly
from a ADE L session configuration for future use. Using OCEAN XL is the best way
to accomplish scripting since it has a built in function to export result waves 
as csv files.
