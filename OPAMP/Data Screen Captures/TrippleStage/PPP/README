 
Instead of having to set up all my tests again I saved the ADE XL Session as a copy.
I then went into the file system and copied 
the ADE XL instance folder from the tristage P to the tri stage N Cell View folder. Now 
all that has to be done is a modification of the resister values and input voltages 
to the AC and DC tests. In the Test Editor the schematic has to be changed
as well otherwise whichever schematic you stole the state from will be used.
